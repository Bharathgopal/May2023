# Data Packet Corruption Detection
* In a Wireless communciation device, multiple data packets are transferred over the air. 
* It is possible that data might get corrupted or lost before it reaches the destination.
* Create a method to identify if a data packet is corrupted
* Assume below format for the data packet

```
#define MAX_PACKET_DATA_LENGTH (50)

typedef struct data_packet_t{
    uint8_t id;
    uint8_t data_length;
    uint8_t data[MAX_PACKET_DATA_LENGTH];
    uint16_t crc;
}data_packet_t;

```
