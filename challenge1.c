/*    *** Data Packet Corruption Detection ***

  In a Wireless communciation device, multiple data packets are transferred over the air.
  It is possible that data might get corrupted or lost before it reaches the destination.
  Create a method to identify if a data packet is corrupted
  Assume below format for the data packet
